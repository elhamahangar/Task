# Task 3: Training Considerations

For Task 3, I've considered various scenarios for freezing different parts of the model during training, as well as a transfer learning approach to improve performance on my tasks. Here’s a breakdown of each scenario:

## Scenario 1: Freezing the Entire Network
- **Implications**: If I freeze the entire network, the model won’t learn any new information from my data. It will simply use the pre-trained weights from the transformer backbone and the task-specific heads without adapting.
- **Advantages**: This approach is very efficient in terms of computational resources and avoids potential overfitting, which is especially useful if I don’t have a lot of labeled data.
- **When to Use**: Freezing everything is useful if I’m short on data or need a quick, reliable deployment with minimal training.

## Scenario 2: Freezing Only the Transformer Backbone
- **Implications**: Freezing only the transformer backbone means that the general language knowledge from the pre-trained model is preserved, but the task-specific heads can still learn from my data.
- **Advantages**: This lets me fine-tune each task-specific head (for classification and sentiment analysis) without changing the backbone. This is a good balance between preserving the powerful language representations in the backbone and adding some flexibility in the output layers.
- **When to Use**: Freezing the backbone while allowing the task heads to adapt works well if I have a moderate amount of data and want to tune each task head just a bit without intensive fine-tuning of the entire model.

## Scenario 3: Freezing Only One Task-Specific Head
- **Implications**: In this setup, I could choose to freeze one task-specific head (say, the sentiment analysis head) while allowing the other (e.g., sentence classification) and the transformer backbone to keep learning.
- **Advantages**: This approach allows me to focus training on just one task if it’s underperforming, while maintaining the performance of the other. Freezing one head is especially useful if I’m satisfied with one task's performance and want to refine the other without any interference.
- **When to Use**: I’d consider this if I have more data for one task than the other or if one task is already performing well while the other needs more attention.

## Transfer Learning Strategy

For transfer learning, I’d start with a strong pre-trained model like `DistilBERT` or `BERT` that already has general language understanding. Here’s how I would approach it:

1. **Choice of Pre-Trained Model**: I’d pick a model like `DistilBERT` or `BERT`, which are trained on large corpora and already understand language structure well.

2. **Layers to Freeze and Unfreeze**:
   - **Freeze Lower Layers**: The lower layers in the transformer backbone capture basic language patterns, so freezing them helps keep that general knowledge intact.
   - **Unfreeze Upper Layers**: I’d unfreeze the upper layers, as they capture more abstract language patterns and can benefit from tuning to my specific tasks. Keeping these layers trainable allows the model to learn task-specific patterns.
   - **Train Task-Specific Heads**: Keeping both task-specific heads unfrozen ensures that they can adapt to their respective tasks (classification or sentiment analysis), fine-tuning based on the data for each task.

3. **Rationale**: By freezing the lower layers, I preserve the foundational language understanding that the model learned during pre-training. Unfreezing the upper layers and the task-specific heads allows the model to fine-tune itself for my specific tasks, balancing general language understanding with task-specific customization.
